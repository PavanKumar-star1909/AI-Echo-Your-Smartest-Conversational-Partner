# Short Results & Next Steps
- Train the baseline model and record metrics in a CSV in artifacts/
- Create EDA visualizations (matplotlib) in notebooks/ and export as PNGs
- Consider trying: Naive Bayes, RandomForest, simple LSTM, and transformer models (HuggingFace)
- For production: containerize with Docker and deploy to a cloud service
